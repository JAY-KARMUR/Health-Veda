            <h2>Introduction to Ayurveda</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-intro">
            <p>Ayurveda, which translates to "knowledge of life," is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. Developed more than 5,000 years ago in India, Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit.</p>
            <p>The primary focus of Ayurveda is to promote good health, rather than fight disease. However, treatments may be recommended for specific health problems.</p>

            <h2>The Five Elements and Three Doshas</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-intro">
            <p>According to Ayurvedic philosophy, the five elements found in all living things—space, air, fire, water, and earth—combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. These doshas control how your body works and are known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.</p>
            <p>Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas, with one or two typically being more dominant. This unique combination is believed to determine your physical and psychological traits, as well as your vulnerability to certain types of health problems.</p>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>Holistic Approach</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda views health as a state of balance between body, mind, and consciousness. It considers all aspects of life, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>Individualized Treatment</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda recognizes that each person is unique with a specific constitution (Prakruti) and current state (Vikruti). Treatments are tailored to the individual rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>Prevention Over Cure</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda emphasizes preventive care and maintaining health through proper diet, lifestyle, and herbal remedies, rather than focusing solely on treating diseases after they occur.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>Balance of Doshas</h3>
                <p>Health is achieved when the three doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—are in balance according to an individual's natural constitution. Imbalances lead to disease.</p>
