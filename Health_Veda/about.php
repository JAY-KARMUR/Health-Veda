            <h2>Understanding Doshas in Ayurveda</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-intro">
            <p>According to Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, each person has a unique constitution or "Prakruti" that is determined by the balance of three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas are energetic forces that govern all physical and mental processes and provide a framework for understanding how to maintain health and balance.</p>
            <p>While everyone has all three doshas, most people have one or two that are more dominant. Understanding your dosha composition can help you make lifestyle choices that promote balance and well-being.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Dosha Balance</h3>
            <p>Most people have a combination of doshas, with one or two being more dominant. Your dominant dosha(s) determine your Prakruti, or your natural constitution. However, your current state, or Vikruti, may differ from your natural constitution due to lifestyle, diet, stress, and other factors.</p>
            <p>The goal of Ayurveda is not to achieve an equal balance of all three doshas, but rather to maintain your natural constitution. When your doshas are in their natural proportions, you experience optimal health and well-being.</p>
